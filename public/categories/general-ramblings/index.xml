      <description>There’s no doubt that we, globally, are going through tough times as the COVID-19 pandemic sweeps through many countries. Every aspect of life has been affected, and this includes sport.
While I live in NZ (and am so grateful to be here, now more than ever), I’ve been keeping a close eye on the news from back home in Australia and elsewhere around the world.

      <description>I often get asked questions about how long I&amp;rsquo;ve been coding for, how I got started, whether I have completed any formal studies in programming / computer science, and so on. The reality is that my path is far from linear. Most of what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to date has been more opportunistic than strategic, curiosity-driven rather than being part of a master plan to acquire professional skills for the workplace.
