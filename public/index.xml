      <description>It’s a touchy subject for many. Yet this very question was posed by Aiden Oakley (@ajoakley on Twitter), and willingly answered by over 100 sport scientists and strength &amp;amp; conditioning coaches who currently work for football (soccer) clubs in the UK.
Why?
This job advert says it all…

      <description>I often get asked questions about how long I&amp;rsquo;ve been coding for, how I got started, whether I have completed any formal studies in programming / computer science, and so on. The reality is that my path is far from linear. Most of what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to date has been more opportunistic than strategic, curiosity-driven rather than being part of a master plan to acquire professional skills for the workplace.</description>

      <description>About the blog &amp;lsquo;Under The Hood&amp;rsquo; is a platform to demonstrate what is possible when we apply analytical techniques to solve problems that matter in sport. Drawing on my own professional experiences, this blog will showcase the many ways in which analytics can be used to discover new insights about the sports we love to play, watch, and support.
About me My name is Jacquie Tran, and I am a sport scientist working in elite sport (Australian Football League).</description>
