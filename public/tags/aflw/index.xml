      <description>(source: AFL Nation)IntroductionThe focus of this post is on creating AFLW team matchplay profiles, using match data from the 2017 and 2018 seasons. By drawing on match data from the 2 completed AFLW seasons thus far, this post also outlines how I think about, analyse, and present insights from small data sets.
For more on retrieving and preparing AFLW match data, check out Part I of this series of posts or this GitHub repo.</description>

      <description>(source: Wikimedia)The countdown is well and truly on.
We are less than 1 week away from the first bounce of AFLW 3.0, the 3rd season of the women’s national Australian football league. As an Aussie living abroad, a footy fan, and a supporter of the increasing professionalisation of women’s sport, I’m excited to watch closely as the next chapter of the AFLW story unfolds.
How will Geelong and North Melbourne, new teams to the national league in 2019, fare against the 8 teams who have participated in AFLW seasons 1 and 2?</description>
