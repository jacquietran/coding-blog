      <description>(source: Wikimedia)The countdown is well and truly on.
We are less than 1 week away from the first bounce of AFLW 3.0, the 3rd season of the women’s national Australian football league. As an Aussie living abroad, a footy fan, and supporter of the increasing professionalisation of women’s sport, I’m excited to watch closely as the next chapter of the AFLW story unfolds.
How will Geelong and North Melbourne, new teams to the national league in 2019, fare against the 8 teams who have participated in AFLW seasons 1 and 2?</description>

      <description>There remains a huge amount of work to be done to explore and understand athlete and team performance in women&amp;rsquo;s sport. This is true for sports that have had professional or elite women&amp;rsquo;s competitions for some time.

Here&amp;rsquo;s a snapshot of the available knowledge about AFLW matchplay:
 I conducted Google and Google Scholar searches for &amp;lsquo;aflw&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;women australian football&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>The backstoryIt’s a touchy subject for many. Yet this question—how much do you get paid?—is at the core of the online questionnaire that was recently administered by Aiden Oakley (@ajoakley on Twitter). And it is a question that was willingly answered by over 100 sport scientists and strength &amp;amp; conditioning coaches who currently work for football (soccer) clubs in the UK.
Why?
This job advert says it all…
This is shocking!</description>
