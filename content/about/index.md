## About the blog

_'Under The Hood'_ is a platform to demonstrate what is possible when we apply analytical techniques to solve problems that matter in sport. Drawing on my own professional experiences, this blog will showcase the many ways in which analytics can be used to discover new insights about the sports we love to play, watch, and support.


## About me

My name is Jacquie Tran, and I am a sport scientist working in elite sport (Australian Football League). I am passionate about translating research into applied outcomes for high performance athletes and coaches. My expertise areas include athlete preparation and performance, load and athlete monitoring, sports analytics, and the use of sensor technology for sporting applications.

I primarily code in R, with fairly regular diversions using SQL, HTML, and CSS.
