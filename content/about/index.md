## What's this all about?

[**Under The Hood**](https://underthehood.jacquietran.com) is a platform to demonstrate what is possible when we apply analytical techniques to solve interesting problems. Drawing on my professional experiences, this blog showcase the many ways in which analytics can be used to discover new insights about the sports we love to play, watch, and support.

(There are lots of things I enjoy beyond sport, and I may blog about these things from time to time too!)

On this blog, I primarily code in R and R Markdown.

In my work, I make fairly regular diversions from R using SQL, HTML, and CSS.
