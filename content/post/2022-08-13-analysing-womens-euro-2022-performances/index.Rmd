# Introduction

Like the shameless bandwagon-er that I am, I set aside my usual allegiances as an Australian, voluntarily woke up at an unmentionable hour in NZ time, and found myself cheering loudly for [England as they brought home the Euros](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/02/pride-of-the-lionesses-englands-road-to-euro-2022-glory-in-pictures).

Shortly after this momentous occasion, [StatsBomb released a treasure trove of free data from the Euros tournament](https://statsbomb.com/articles/soccer/statsbomb-release-free-360-data-womens-euro-2022-available-now/)!

Here are a few different ways I explored the data:

# Shot outcomes by team
