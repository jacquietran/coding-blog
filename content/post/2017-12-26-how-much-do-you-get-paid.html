<p>It‚Äôs a touchy subject for many. Yet this very question was posed by <a href="www.twitter.com/ajokaley">Aiden Oakley</a> (<strong><span class="citation">@ajoakley</span></strong> on Twitter), and willingly answered by over 100 sport scientists and strength &amp; conditioning coaches who currently work for football (soccer) clubs in the UK.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>This job advert says it all‚Ä¶</p>

This is shocking! ‚ÄúDear Candidate, please spend ¬£27,000 on BSc, then ¬£1000 on ASCC, to be paid less than half of this. Oh, and the players earn your salary in one week.‚Äù ü§îü§îü§î <a href="https://t.co/6efKtAaaQl">pic.twitter.com/6efKtAaaQl</a>

<p>Blackpool FC was roundly criticised for advertising such a position for a measly ¬£12,000 per annum. The UK Strength &amp; Conditioning Association then withdrew this job posting from their website. Regrettably, this is not a one-off. Blackpool happened to rightly draw the ire of the Twitter crowd on this occasion, but many of us working in sport have seen too many job ads just like this one.</p>
<p>So what is the current state of play when it comes to salaries in UK soccer?</p>
<p>Aiden set out to explore this question by surveying a sample of sport scientists and strength and conditioning coaches via Twitter:</p>

<p>After a fortnight, 100+ responses were received. I put my hand up to help with visualising the data.</p>
<div id="getting-started" class="section level2">
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Firstly, let‚Äôs load the cleaned data in and load the necessary libraries. <em>Note: Some variables were omitted during the data cleaning process to protect the anonymity of respondents.</em></p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(readr)

<p>Now that we have the cleaned data loaded in, we can begin to examine it. The data set has 16 variables and 102 responses. For pedants like me, you can scroll to the bottom of this post to see the data dictionary.</p>

<h2>Salaries by league</h2>
<p>Let‚Äôs start with a simple plot to answer a simple question: <strong>what are the reported salaries of performance support staff working in UK soccer clubs when categorised by league?</strong> (It‚Äôs worth noting here that this refers to the league in which the club‚Äôs first team plays, so it may not be the league that the respondent may predominantly work within, e.g., if they support the Academy programs.)</p>
<p>After a quick exploration when I first started working with this data set, I noticed that salaries varied considerably between respondents. To capture this, I decided to build box plots (to represent ‚Äòtypical‚Äô salaries within a particular category), overlaid with a scatter plot where each dot represents one respondent. I also chose to present the the x axis categories such that the leagues progress from higher tier to lower tier as your gaze moves left to right.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Set factor levels

<p>What do these results indicate?</p>
<p><strong>1. Across the board, typical salaries are low.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Given that 80 respondents were qualified at Masters or PhD level, these figures seem low. Such individuals might be competitive for university lecturer positions. <a href="https://staffrecruitment.coventry.ac.uk/tlive_webrecruitment/wrd/run/ETREC107GF.open?VACANCY_ID=954467Gmbh&amp;WVID=1861420Izv&amp;LANG=USA&amp;utm_source=Indeed&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=Indeed">Coventry University</a> is advertising for an Assistant Lecturer in Sport and Exercise Science with a stated salary range of ~¬£26,000‚Äì¬£35,000 per annum. Meanwhile, a Lecturer / Senior Lecturer in Research Methods role at <a href="https://vacancies.ntu.ac.uk/displayjob.aspx?jobid=4698">Nottingham Trent</a> will pay somewhere in the range of ~¬£33,000‚Äì¬£48,000 per annum.</li>
<li>FYI the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates">UK‚Äôs National Living Wage</a> for individuals aged 25 and over is ¬£7.50 per hour (as from April 2017). With some ‚Äòback of the napkin‚Äô math, this works out to a full-time salary of approximately ¬£12,600 per annum - calculated as ¬£7.50 per hour x (35 hours / week) x (48 weeks / year).</li>
<li>For the Australians among us (<em>puts hand up</em>), the typical salary for a performance support staff member working for a Scottish Premiership team‚Äî¬£26,000‚Äîworks out to roughly $45,000 AUD (based on the exchange rate on 28/12/2017). Level A academics are paid approximately $64,000‚Äì$86,000 and Level B academics are paid approximately $91,000‚Äì$18,000 (according to <a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/41472/salary-rates-academic.pdf">Deakin‚Äôs pay scales</a> from April 2016).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Performance support staff working for Scottish Premiership teams appear to be paid slghtly better than their counterparts in the Premier League.</strong> Having said that, it‚Äôs quite possible that this difference may be due to the small sub-sample of respondents in the Scottish Premiership category (n = 6).</p>
<p><strong>3. There is considerable variation within most leagues.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The ‚Äò¬£0‚Äô salaries have been left in the data set as a handful of (unpaid!!!) interns completed the questionnaire. Even if you were to remove these data points, though, sizeable variation remains. Also, the median is robust to outliers, so typical salaries do not change or change by a negligible amount when interns are excluded from the data set.</li>
<li>This is partially due to some respondents working part-time in their roles. It was possible to identify whether some individuals were working part-time, based on the data entered by some participants, but the questionnaire itself did not explicitly ask this question.</li>
</ul>

<div id="salaries-by-league-and-competitive-level" class="section level1">
<h1>Salaries by league and competitive level</h1>
<p>We can drill down further, plotting the data by league <em>and</em> by competitive level; that is, whether respondents work for their club‚Äôs first team or academy.</p>

<p>Categorising by league and what I‚Äôve termed ‚Äòcompetitive level‚Äô (first team vs.¬†academy) helps to better visualise the salary gradient across the different leagues. This segmentation of the data gives us a better look at salary breakdowns, but also divides the relatively small sample into even smaller sub-groups. For instance, there were only 2 respondents who work for a Scottish Premiership first team, and only 3 respondents who work for a League 2 academy. Anyway, the data is the data, so let‚Äôs press on while keeping in mind that <em>the results seen here may not hold with a larger sample and more representation within each sub-group.</em></p>
<p>Caveats notwithstanding, the results show that:</p>
<p><strong>1. The typical salary of Premier League first team support staff (¬£40,000) is higher than for those who work for Scottish Premiership first teams (¬£31,250).</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. The differences between leagues are stark in terms of first team staff salaries, while the gradient is not so steep when it comes to academy staff salaries.</strong></p>

<h2>Ways to improve the questionnaire</h2>
<ul>
<li>Future questionnaires need to specifically ask participants to identify the nature of their work in terms of whether they are full-time, part-time, casual, or volunteer / intern. It would also be helpful to know, for those not in full-time roles especially, an estimate of hours worked per week. This would allow pro rata annual salaries and hourly rates to be calculated.</li>
