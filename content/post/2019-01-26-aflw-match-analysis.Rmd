The countdown is well and truly on.

We are but 1 week away from the first bounce of AFLW 3.0, the 3rd season of the women's national Australian football league. As an Aussie living abroad, a footy fan, and supporter of the increasing professionalisation of women's sport, I'm excited to watch closely as the next chapter of the AFLW story unfolds.

How will Geelong and North Melbourne, new teams to the national league in 2019, fare against the 8 teams who have participated in AFLW seasons 1 and 2?

What will the new draftees like [Maddie Prespakis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAhPnRRsm0E) and [Nina Morrison](http://www.geelongcats.com.au/video/2018-10-23/nina-morrison-highlights) bring to mix at senior-level?

Which [international players](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/21/irelands-emerald-armada-set-to-take-the-aflw-by-storm) and [cross-coders](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/14/fearsome-sharni-layton-well-set-to-join-elite-band-of-sport-switchers) will show the potential success to be had in talent transfers?

How will the [conference format](https://thewomensgame.com/news/opinion-aflw-conference-format-518039) and [rule changes](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/07/aflw-tweaks-rules-for-next-season-to-promote-more-scoring) play out?

## The analysis questions

There's excitement in looking forward and lots to be learned from looking back too, so I decided to explore match data from the 2017 and 2018 AFLW seasons, with thanks to the excellent `fitzRoy` package for R, which I played around with in **[my last blog post](https://underthehood.jacquietran.com/2019/01/12/getting-to-know-the-fitzroy-package-afl-game-statistics/)**.
