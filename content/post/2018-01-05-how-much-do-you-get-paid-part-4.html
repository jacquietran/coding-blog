<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This post is the <strong>fourth</strong> in a series - I suggest reading the <a href="/2018/01/02/how-much-do-you-get-paid-part-1/">first</a>, <a href="/2018/01/03/how-much-do-you-get-paid-part-2/">second</a>, and <a href="/2018/01/04/how-much-do-you-get-paid-part-3/">third</a> posts for background. In this series, I will show how I created the plots that <a href="https://www.twitter.com/ajoakley/">Aiden Oakley</a> published on Twitter <a href="https://www.twitter.com/ajoakley/status/944564698166513665/">here</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ajoakley/status/944936008285552642/">here</a>, alongside some commentary about the choices I made throughout the process and my own interpretations of the results.</p>

<h1>Salaries by academy category</h1>
<p>In England, the Football Association (FA) sets the academy status of all football clubs with academy programs, as part of their <a href="http://www.thefa.com/~/media/C2FB1444624F4367AA477A72D94B50BF.ashx">Elite Player Performance Plan</a>. Club academies are audited and given a status of Category 1 to 4, with 1 being the highest tier possible. Meanwhile, in Scotland, <a href="http://www.youthfootballscotland.co.uk/gots/item/19915-scottish-fa-make-project-brave-announcement.html">a new academy structure has been recently introduced</a> with three levels: Elite (the highest tier), Progressive (the middle tier), and Performance (the lowest tier). In both countries, different levels of grant funding are awarded based on their academy category.</p>
<p>For context (and my own understanding), I’ve patched together a range of news sources to collate the following information about category-specific funding:</p>
<ul>
<li>In England, grants are awarded to academies based on their category status and are scaled to a percentage of their operational budget, according to this <a href="http://www.hltco.org/2012/08/01/what-the-eppp-means-for-us/">source</a>. Therefore, the absolute values cited below are ‘ball-park’ figures.</li>
<li><strong>Category 1</strong> academies received a minimum £775,000 per year as a grant from the Premier League’s youth development fund in 2013, according to <a href="http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2013/01/25/3699412/arsenal-liverpool-tottenham-win-top-academy-grade-but">an article by Wayne Veysey for Goal.com</a>.</li>
<li>According to the <a href="http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2013/01/25/3699412/arsenal-liverpool-tottenham-win-top-academy-grade-but">Veysey article</a>, <strong>Category 2</strong> academies could expect a minimum of £480,000 in funding in 2013. <a href="https://www.ccfc.co.uk/news/2016/june/news-richard-stevens-on-what-it-means-to-have-a-category-ii-football-academy-/">In a news item from 2016 by Laura Hunter for the Coventry City FC website</a>, their Category 2 academy received ~£500,000 in funding that year.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2013/01/25/3699412/arsenal-liverpool-tottenham-win-top-academy-grade-but">Veysey article</a> states that <strong>Category 3</strong> academies received a minimum of £210,000 in funding in 2013.</li>
<li><strong>Category 4</strong> academies received a minimum of £100,000 in funding in 2013, as per <a href="http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2013/01/25/3699412/arsenal-liverpool-tottenham-win-top-academy-grade-but">Veysey</a>.</li>
<li>I couldn’t find any public information on funding for Scottish academies, which might be due to the fact that the new academy structure was finalised recently, <a href="https://www.scottishfa.co.uk/news/project-brave-update/">in November 2017</a>. Do you know of any reliable information sources on this topic? <a href="https://www.twitter.com/jacquietran">Send me links via Twitter!</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing this, it makes sense to investigate whether academy category (read: academy budget) affects the salaries of performance support staff in the UK.</p>
<p><em>Side note: Two respondents working in Scotland indicated that their category status was ‘Development’. This is not one of the three new academy categories set by the Scottish Football Association as I undersatnd it. Since it wasn’t clear which one of the three this text entry might correspond to, I have decided to leave it as is for this analysis. If anyone can give me clarity on which category this might be (perhaps someone reading this blog post might have provided this particular response?), then I can amend the plot and table below accordingly.</em></p>

<h2>Key findings</h2>
<p>For the record, I am not <em>super</em> familiar with the lay of the land when it comes to football in the UK, so my interpretations are based on the relevant texts I’ve read on the topic of stratifying football academies into ‘categories’. That said, this is what I see in the results above:</p>
