## Introduction
This post is the sixth and final in a series - go on and read the **first**, **second**, **third**, **fourth**, and **fifth** posts for background. In this series, I will show how I created the plots that Aiden published on Twitter [here](www.twitter.com/ajoakley/status/944564698166513665) and [here](https://twitter.com/ajoakley/status/944936008285552642), alongside some commentary about the choices I made throughout the process and my own interpretations of the results.

## Ways to improve the questionnaire

- Ask participants to identify the nature of their work in terms of whether they are full-time, part-time, casual, or volunteer / intern. It would also be helpful to know, for those not in full-time roles especially, an estimate of hours worked per week. This would allow hourly rates and pro rata annual salaries (if appropriate) to be calculated.
