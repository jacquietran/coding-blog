<p>The countdown is well and truly on.</p>
<p>We are but 1 week away from the first bounce of AFLW 3.0, the 3rd season of the women’s national Australian football league. As an Aussie living abroad, a footy fan, and supporter of the increasing professionalisation of women’s sport, I’m excited to watch closely as the next chapter of the AFLW story unfolds.</p>
<p>How will Geelong and North Melbourne, new teams to the national league in 2019, fare against the 8 teams who have participated in AFLW seasons 1 and 2?</p>
<p>What will the new draftees like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAhPnRRsm0E">Maddie Prespakis</a> and <a href="http://www.geelongcats.com.au/video/2018-10-23/nina-morrison-highlights">Nina Morrison</a> bring to mix at senior-level?</p>
<p>Which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/21/irelands-emerald-armada-set-to-take-the-aflw-by-storm">international players</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/14/fearsome-sharni-layton-well-set-to-join-elite-band-of-sport-switchers">cross-coders</a> will show the potential success to be had in talent transfers?</p>
<p>How will the <a href="https://thewomensgame.com/news/opinion-aflw-conference-format-518039">conference format</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/nov/07/aflw-tweaks-rules-for-next-season-to-promote-more-scoring">rule changes</a> play out?</p>

<h2>The analysis questions</h2>
<p>There’s excitement in looking forward and lots to be learned from looking back too, so I decided to explore match data from the 2017 and 2018 AFLW seasons, with thanks to the excellent <code>fitzRoy</code> package for R, which I played around with in <strong><a href="https://underthehood.jacquietran.com/2019/01/12/getting-to-know-the-fitzroy-package-afl-game-statistics/">my last blog post</a></strong>.</p>
