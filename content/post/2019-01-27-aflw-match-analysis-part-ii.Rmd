I'll show how the available match data can be used to:

1. Create team-by-team matchplay profiles; and
2. Investigate the game statistics that are associated with successful team outcomes.

As an aside, I hope to demonstrate what can be gleaned from a small sample, while also acknowledging their limitations.
