There remains a huge amount of work to be done to explore and understand athlete and team performance in women's sport. This is true for sports that have had professional or elite women's competitions for some time. It's especially pertinent in sports like Australian football, in which the top-tier women's competition was only established in 2017.

Here's a snapshot of the available knowledge about AFLW matchplay:

- I conducted Google and Google Scholar searches for _'aflw'_ and _'women australian football'_.
- I combed through links on the first few pages of results, identifying pieces of work that focused specifically on aspects of AFLW matchplay.
- I could only find 3 papers that feature data from AFLW players and matches (there are a handful more if you include women's state leagues and academies)
