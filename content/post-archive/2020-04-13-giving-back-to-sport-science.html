<p>There‚Äôs no doubt that we, globally, are going through tough times as the COVID-19 pandemic sweeps through many countries. Every aspect of life has been affected, and this includes sport.</p>
<p>While I live in NZ (and am <em>so</em> grateful to be here, now more than ever), I‚Äôve been keeping a close eye on the news from back home in Australia and elsewhere around the world. Friends and colleagues throughout sport have been heavily impacted - many having been stood down without pay or made redundant altogether.</p>
<p>In these times, I want to give back to the sport science community. So I posted this call-out on Twitter recently:</p>
